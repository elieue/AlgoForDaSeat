## üöÄ Machine Problems Included

### **üîç Machine Problem #2: Brute Force Algorithm**
- **Objective:** Implement and analyze brute force algorithms.
- **Description:** Brute force is a fundamental algorithm design technique that systematically checks all possible solutions until the correct one is found. This problem focuses on classic brute force examples such as:
  - **Selection Sort** and **Bubble Sort** (basic sorting)
  - **Sequential Search** (linear searching)
  - **Traveling Salesman Problem** and **Knapsack Problem** (optimization challenges)
- **Key Takeaways:** Time complexity analysis, efficiency comparisons, and insights into brute force limitations.

### **‚öñÔ∏è Machine Problem #3: Limitations of Decrease and Conquer**
- **Objective:** Explore the decrease and conquer paradigm and identify its constraints.
- **Description:** The decrease and conquer strategy reduces a problem instance to a smaller sub-instance and solves it recursively. This problem highlights:
  - **Binary Search** (efficient searching)
  - **Insertion Sort** (incremental sorting)
  - **Topological Sorting** (graph-based ordering)
- **Challenges Discussed:** When and where decrease and conquer may be inefficient, trade-offs in computational complexity, and scenarios where other strategies might be more suitable.

### **üîÑ Machine Problem #4: Divide and Conquer vs. Greedy Algorithms**
- **Objective:** Compare and contrast divide and conquer with greedy approaches.
- **Description:** This problem examines two distinct problem-solving methods:
  - **Divide and Conquer:** Recursive division of problems, applied in algorithms such as **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Binary Search Tree operations**.
  - **Greedy Algorithms:** Locally optimal decisions aiming for a global optimum, demonstrated in **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**, **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm**, and **Huffman Encoding**.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Effectiveness in different problem domains, advantages and disadvantages, and cases where one strategy outperforms the other.

## üìÇ Submission Details
- **Group Collaboration:** Each problem must be solved collectively, ensuring proper division of tasks among team members.
- **Documentation:** The report should include algorithm explanations, pseudocode, complexity analysis, and sample implementations.
- **Final Deliverable:** A compiled document containing solutions, discussions, and code implementations.
